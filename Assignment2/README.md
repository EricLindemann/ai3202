To run this use: "python Lindemann_assignment2.py worldname 1" for manhattan distance
or: "python Lindemann_assignment2.py worldname 2" for diagonal distance heuristic

diagonal distance uses the a^2 = b^2 + c^2, then multiplies a * 14 to get a distance that is always shorter than or equal to the best possible case. The diagonal distance heuristic provides exactly the same number of nodes visited and paths as the manhattan distance heuristic.
