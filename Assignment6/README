input:
probabilityType = g-> conditional, j-> joint and m-> marginal
changesInProbability = S.4,P.3 (sets chance of smoking to .4 and low pollution to .3) None leaves defaults
whatToUse = P,S,CPS (Pollution, Smoking and Cancer is true)
Lindemann_Assignment6.py probabilityType changesInProbability whatToUse
e.g:
Lindemann_Assignment6.py j P.4 P,S (joint probability of smoking and pollution being low with the probability of low pollution being .4)
Lindemann_Assignment6.py g None CPS,D (probability of cancer given dyspnoea is true)

working conditionals:
CPS,D
CPS,S
X,S
D,CPS
