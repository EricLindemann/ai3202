Run my program by typing:
python Lindemann_Asssignment5.py WorldName EpsilonValue

Changing the value of epsilon did nothing for the directions I should choose. When epsilon is very high (~.01) the directions should go towards barns and the goal. When it is very low (< -2) it should prioritize getting to the goal as quickly as possible.
